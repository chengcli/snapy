# FP32 project progress

Updated: 2026-11-08. Roadmap: [FP32_ROADMAP.md](FP32_ROADMAP.md).

## Milestones

| Milestone | Status | Evidence / next action |
|---|---|---|
| M0 Baseline and records | CPU validated | Fresh paired build and 33-case foundation gate passed |
| M1 Reference consolidation | Implemented, CPU validated | Shared operator, cache invalidation, composition restart; CUDA pending |
| M2 Thermodynamic perturbations | Implemented, CPU validated | Delta thermodynamics, exact total reads and FP32 floors pass; hydro wiring follows |
| M3 Perturbation dynamics | In progress | HLLC CPU/tensor and gravity-work pieces pass; reference splitting/hydro wiring remain |
| M4 True FP32 | Planned | Follow perturbation kernels |
| M5 Coupled workflow/restart | Planned | Validate actual kintera build |
| M6 Science/performance | Planned | Requires production GPU and coupled cases |

Snapy foundations are recorded on `fp32-step1-anomaly`, based on `fe003dd`.
The paired kintera change is commit `80ac117` on `fp32-perturbation-thermo`, based
on user-rebased `v2.6.8` / `e646fe5`. Fresh CPU validation uses the paired source
builds, not the globally installed packages.

## Validation log

- Prior inspection: `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R
  'test_(balance_column|hydro_ref_x1)\.release$'`: 2/2 passed using existing
  binaries. Registry lacked newer anomaly tests; not current-source validation.
- `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON`: passed;
  resolved installed kintera 2.6.6.
- `cmake --build build --parallel 4 --target test_balance_column.release test_hydro_ref_x1.release test_fp32_storage.release`:
  failed before project compilation because cached Xcode SDK was missing
  (`cstddef`, `stdio.h` not found).
- Reconfigured successfully with
  `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk`.
  Retried the same build; in progress. Logs: `/tmp/snapy-fp32-build.log`.
- User rebased kintera: source `v2.6.8`, commit `e646fe5`; installed Python package
  still 2.6.6. Isolated source copy at `/tmp/snapy-fp32-kintera-2.6.8` configured
  successfully using the installed SDK; building `kintera_release`.

## Decisions — 2026-11-08

- Jupiter Cartesian ideal-moist first; perturbation kernels before true FP32.
- Initial balancing remains opt-in; preserve unbalanced-state residual forces.
- Reuse well-balanced machinery; distinguish static and dynamic references.
- Kintera source edits authorized for moist physics. Keep repository responsibilities.
- Record exact commands/results and cross-repo compatibility at each checkpoint.

## Environment and outstanding work

Local host is macOS/CPU; CUDA and production GPU validation require another host.
Dependency resolution is now pinned to the isolated kintera v2.6.8 source build
plus this change. Python tests use `/tmp/snapy-fp32-python` (kintera 2.6.8+fp32
and the rebuilt snapy extension/library). Global Python packages were not replaced.
Coupled Jupiter cases live outside this repository and were not found in the
local workspace search. The temporary build/install paths are local validation
artifacts; a clean host must build/install the paired sources itself.

## Implementation checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- Added `HydroReferenceX1Operator` shared by runtime and `balance_column`.
  Retains legacy nonuniform vs stretched operator choice, runtime seam ordering,
  and wb_ref4 placement. Geometry cache checks identity/version/dtype/device.
- Added tests comparing shared evaluation with existing dispatch for float/double,
  uniform/nonuniform/stretched grids and cache invalidation on edits/conversion.
- Added FP64 species background and optional `hydro_ref_species` restart field.
  Legacy restarts remain supported for storage; absent composition is explicitly
  unavailable, never inferred from evolved species or stale initialization.
- Added species background conversion and restart checks to anomaly tests.
- Compatibility: new restart field is additive. Older writers lack composition
  needed by future perturbation thermodynamics; existing anomaly storage does not
  require it. No kintera source changes yet.

## Thermodynamics checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- Kintera source at v2.6.8 now has `eval_const_cv_pressure_delta` and
  `test_pressure_delta`: direct constant-cv mixture pressure increments, with
  tests for sub-ulp heating and composition changes. Changes are in the original
  neighboring checkout; the temporary build copy contains the same edits.
- `cmake --build /tmp/snapy-fp32-kintera-2.6.8/build --parallel 4 --target test_pressure_delta.release`:
  passed.
- `ctest --test-dir /tmp/snapy-fp32-kintera-2.6.8/build --output-on-failure -R '^test_pressure_delta.release$'`:
  1/1 passed (two gtest cases).
- Snapy now has an internal ideal-moist perturbation result carrying background
  and delta density/pressure. Uses source double coefficients, species energy
  offsets and kinetic energy; does not mutate or limit input. Not yet connected
  to the hydro sweep. Variable heat capacities are explicitly unsupported here.
- FP32 total reconstruction promotes before addition. Active FP32 anomaly floors
  round upward when needed; inactive cells stay encoded as supplied.
- Added direct snapy EOS tests for these contracts; validation pending.
- Compatibility: this branch now requires the paired kintera header helper;
  CMake checks capability explicitly instead of pretending an unreleased API is
  present in stock 2.6.8. Python extension headers follow the imported kintera
  package so isolated paired builds do not silently use global-install headers.
- Snapy reconfiguration selects `/tmp/snapy-fp32-kintera-2.6.8` headers and its
  `build/lib/libkintera_release.dylib` via `_KINTERA_HEADER_DIR`,
  `KINTERA_INCLUDE_DIR`, and `KINTERA_LIBRARY`; rebuilding EOS and reference tests.

## Gravity-work checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- Added a shared local-potential-difference face-work helper. Cartesian explicit
  hydro and the implicit post-solve correction now use it; non-Cartesian explicit
  behavior remains on its existing formula. Physical wall and radial correction
  handling stays in the callers.
- Tests cover FP64 energy identity, conservation with closed walls, and FP32
  translation invariance with large-origin FP64 coordinates. Validation pending.
- Kintera changes are on `fp32-perturbation-thermo`, based on user-rebased v2.6.8.
- Isolated kintera wheel `2.6.8+fp32` built and installed at
  `/tmp/snapy-fp32-python`; import check confirms that path and version.
- `git diff --check` and `python -m py_compile tests/test_anomaly_storage.py setup.py`:
  passed. These are static checks, not numerical validation.

## CPU validation checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- First expanded EOS run exposed mixed-dtype assumptions in coordinate vector
  transforms and species repair. Fixed explicit geometry/repair compute views;
  rerun passed (no tolerance relaxation).
- `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R 'test_(eos|coordinate|balance_column|hydro_ref_x1|fp32_storage|gravity_work_cache_to|implicit_face_work_jacobian)\.release$'`:
  **7/7 passed**. CUDA parameterizations skip on this CPU build.
- `PYTHONPATH=/tmp/snapy-fp32-python python tests/test_anomaly_storage.py`:
  **PASS**, all seven arms. Includes species-background storage and restart;
  anomaly on/off maximum relative total-state difference 5.678e-13 over 10 steps;
  same-dtype restart is bit-identical with anomaly both on and off.
- HLLC now has a separate C++ `forward_perturbations` contract. The shared scalar
  kernel accepts face pressure backgrounds, preserves small pressure differences,
  and uses total pressure in energy transport. CPU, CUDA and tensor dispatch
  are wired; normal `forward` retains its total-state contract.
- `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R '^test_riemann.release$'`:
  **1/1 passed**, including all direction/contact-branch comparisons, sub-ulp
  pressure differences, moist species fluxes and CPU-vs-tensor fallback parity.
  CUDA tests were skipped; CUDA source is not compiled on this host.
- Final configure selects paired kintera **2.6.8** (source plus local changes),
  and `SNAPY_TEST_PYTHONPATH=/tmp/snapy-fp32-python` ensures Python CTests use
  the rebuilt branch instead of the globally installed snapy.

## Remaining implementation (not completed by the foundation work)

1. Split the shared hydrostatic reference's linear scan from its nonlinear
   anchor/guards/density operator. Cache static background evaluations and
   invalidate them on reference/restart/geometry changes.
2. Wire pressure and density perturbations into reconstruction and the new HLLC
   entry point in all directions. Preserve static residual forces, wall parity,
   distributed anchors, seam face pressures, and positivity fallback semantics.
   A balanced reference's constant pressure gauge must not reintroduce a large
   FP32 reconstruction offset. Nonlinear reconstruction must not be treated as
   additive for arbitrary nonuniform background residuals.
3. Add the opt-in dynamics switch only with the complete reference/flux/source
   contract. It is deliberately not exposed as a working hydro mode yet.
4. Implement M4 dtype plumbing/FP64 implicit and chemistry boundaries, then M5
   coupled driver/regrid/dtype-aware restart and M6 science/performance gates.
5. CUDA host and reduced Jupiter workspace location requested asynchronously;
   neither is available locally. CUDA/production acceptance remains pending.

## Historical storage-only results

These are reported by the original roadmap, **not rerun in this work**. Errors
are maximum velocity differences from its FP64 total-storage baseline.

| Reduced case | FP32 total storage | FP32 anomaly storage |
|---|---:|---:|
| Rest, 200 steps | 2.6e-5 m/s | 3.1e-7 m/s |
| Bottom heating, 200 steps | 2.6e-5 m/s | 3.9e-7 m/s |
| Full physics, 500 steps | 6.8e-4 m/s | 1.1e-5 m/s |

These storage-emulation measurements do not demonstrate true FP32 arithmetic.

## Reproducing the current foundation gate

Current CMake configuration was generated with:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=/tmp/snapy-fp32-python cmake -S . -B build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk \
  -D_KINTERA_HEADER_DIR=/tmp/snapy-fp32-kintera-2.6.8/kintera \
  -DKINTERA_INCLUDE_DIR=/tmp/snapy-fp32-kintera-2.6.8 \
  -DKINTERA_LIBRARY=/tmp/snapy-fp32-kintera-2.6.8/build/lib/libkintera_release.dylib \
  -DKINTERA_DATA_DIR=/tmp/snapy-fp32-python/kintera/data \
  -DSNAPY_TEST_PYTHONPATH=/tmp/snapy-fp32-python
```

The final C++ build command (passed):

```sh
cmake --build build --parallel 4 --target \
  test_eos.release test_coordinate.release test_fp32_storage.release \
  test_balance_column.release test_hydro_ref_x1.release \
  test_gravity_work_cache_to.release test_implicit_face_work_jacobian.release \
  test_riemann.release test_stretched_x1_ref.release \
  test_hydro_ref_x1_rf_wall.release test_wb_ref_wall.release \
  test_wb_wall_corner.release test_x1_seam_split.release
```

The local Python extension was built with:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=/tmp/snapy-fp32-python \
SDKROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk MAX_JOBS=4 \
python -m pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation \
  --target /tmp/snapy-fp32-python .
```

After the final library rebuild, refreshed its packaged copy:
`cp build/lib/libsnap_release.dylib /tmp/snapy-fp32-python/snapy/lib/libsnap_release.dylib`.
Use matching include/library/install paths on another host; the SDK option is
macOS-specific. `fp32-foundations` labels the 26 C++/environment cases and seven
Python integration cases for the work implemented so far. It is not a substitute
for M3 hydro integration or the M4–M6 acceptance gates.

## Final validated checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -L fp32-foundations`:
  **33/33 passed**, 57.69 seconds. Covers the current EOS/reference/HLLC/gravity
  changes, wall and stretched-grid variants, in-process split columns, and seven
  Python integrations using this branch. CUDA parameterizations are skipped;
  no production-GPU or remote-process validation is claimed.
- `ctest --test-dir /tmp/snapy-fp32-kintera-2.6.8/build --output-on-failure -R '^test_pressure_delta.release$'`:
  **1/1 passed** (two numerical cases).
- `git diff --check` in snapy and kintera, and
  `python -m py_compile tests/test_anomaly_storage.py setup.py`: **passed**.
- The overall overhaul is **not complete**: M3 reference/reconstruction/source
  integration and M4–M6 remain open as listed above. No true-FP32 Jupiter run or
  performance claim is made. CUDA host/workspace information is still pending.
- Cross-repo requirement: build the paired kintera helper with this snapy branch;
  stock kintera 2.6.8 lacks the new header API. New restart composition metadata
  is additive; legacy anomaly storage still works, but perturbation EOS requires
  the original composition rather than guessing it from an evolved restart.

## PR #326 rebase and CI repair — 2026-11-09

- Rebased onto snapy main `3c891cb` (#337 radial wall refresh and #338 species
  positivity limiter). The rebase applied without textual conflicts.
- Kintera #155 merged as `b8e726ce2fb1538aa15f0787fdcef732d9cdc997`, tagged
  `v2.6.9`. Raised the CMake, Python build/runtime, and release-workflow minimum
  to 2.6.9; removed the temporary unreleased-header probe.
- The failed macOS CI job installed kintera 2.6.6 and stopped in CMake. PyPI does
  not yet offer 2.6.9, so CI builds the exact merged/tagged commit from source
  before configuring snapy. Package release builds require that dependency to
  be published (or preinstalled from source); a version bump alone is insufficient.
- Resolved the semantic interaction with #338: species positivity now uses
  total dry density through `dry_density`, including in anomaly mode. Added
  2-D/3-D anomaly cases to `test_tracer_ratio.py` and its CPU test to the
  `fp32-foundations` gate. Scalar transport already used total dry density.

Validation uses a fresh source build of kintera v2.6.9 in
`/tmp/snapy-326-kintera` and an isolated install at `/tmp/snapy-326-python`.
The earlier 2.6.8 paired-build results above remain historical checkpoints.

Reproduction (macOS SDK flag is host-specific):

```sh
git clone --branch v2.6.9 --depth 1 https://github.com/chengcli/kintera.git /tmp/snapy-326-kintera
cmake -S /tmp/snapy-326-kintera -B /tmp/snapy-326-kintera/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DNETCDF=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk
cmake --build /tmp/snapy-326-kintera/build --parallel 4
(cd /tmp/snapy-326-kintera && SDKROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk MAX_JOBS=4 python -m pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation --target /tmp/snapy-326-python .)
PYTHONPATH=/tmp/snapy-326-python cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk -D_KINTERA_HEADER_DIR=/tmp/snapy-326-python/kintera/kintera -DKINTERA_INCLUDE_DIR=/tmp/snapy-326-python/kintera -DKINTERA_LIBRARY=/tmp/snapy-326-python/kintera/lib/libkintera_release.dylib -DKINTERA_DATA_DIR=/tmp/snapy-326-python/kintera/data -DSNAPY_TEST_PYTHONPATH=/tmp/snapy-326-python
cmake --build build --parallel 4 --target test_eos.release test_coordinate.release test_fp32_storage.release test_balance_column.release test_hydro_ref_x1.release test_gravity_work_cache_to.release test_implicit_face_work_jacobian.release test_riemann.release test_stretched_x1_ref.release test_hydro_ref_x1_rf_wall.release test_wb_ref_wall.release test_wb_wall_corner.release test_x1_seam_split.release test_cubed_sphere_exchange.release
PYTHONPATH=/tmp/snapy-326-python SDKROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk MAX_JOBS=4 python -m pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation --target /tmp/snapy-326-python .
```

Validation results:

- The dependency configure/build/install and snapy configure/build/install
  commands above all passed; CMake detected kintera **2.6.9**.
- `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -L fp32-foundations`:
  **34/34 passed**, 62.83 seconds, including the new tracer-ratio cases.
- `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R '^test_cubed_sphere_exchange.release$'`:
  **1/1 passed**, 6.14 seconds, including main's radial wall refresh regression.
- `PYTHONPATH=/tmp/snapy-326-python python tests/test_tracer_ratio.py`:
  **passed**; both anomaly cases preserve ratios within 7e-16.
- `git diff --check`, `python -m py_compile tests/test_tracer_ratio.py`, and
  `pre-commit run --files FP32_PROGRESS.md FP32_ROADMAP.md .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/release.yml CMakeLists.txt cmake/modules/FindKintera.cmake pyproject.toml src/hydro/hydro_forward.cpp tests/CMakeLists.txt tests/test_tracer_ratio.py`:
  **passed**.
- Local validation is macOS CPU only. CUDA and production FP32 acceptance
  remain outstanding; milestone scope is unchanged.

### Linux CI follow-up

CI run `42645426999` passed pre-commit and macOS (4/4 tests). Linux passed its
build/install but failed one CTest: `test_uranus_cycle1_abort.release`. The dry
abort fixture has no reacting species; kintera 2.6.9's Jacobian attempted to
slice a zero-length species axis and threw before snapy's intended redo/exit
handling. This was reproduced locally with the tagged dependency.

`run_hydro` now skips the chemistry update when its stoichiometry is empty.
The existing abort assertion is unchanged, and failed assertions now include
the captured subprocess log. The two moist Uranus cases continue to execute
chemistry. No kintera source modification is needed for this caller fix.

- `cmake --build build --parallel 4 --target test_uranus_cycle1_abort.release run_hydro.release`: passed.
- `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R '^test_uranus_cycle1_abort.release$'`:
  **failed before the fix; passed after**, 1/1 CTest containing three cases,
  1.42 seconds.
- `pre-commit run --files examples/run_hydro.cpp tests/test_uranus_cycle1_abort.cpp`
  and `git diff --check`: passed.
- `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R '^test_example_ic_stretched_python$'`:
  **1/1 passed**, 2.73 seconds.
