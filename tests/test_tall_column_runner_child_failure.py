"""The tall-column runner fails when a ladder child fails (#299).

test_implicit_gravity_tall_column.py runs its face ladder in two child processes and judges the
JSON rows they print. A child that dies (an exception exits 1, as a failing rung did) or one that
prints an incomplete ladder must fail the parent. A sitecustomize.py on PYTHONPATH injects the
fault into the --ladder children only; the parent is untouched:
  raise:  the children cannot import snapy (an uncaught exception, exit 1, no rows);
  silent: the children exit 0 before printing any row.
Each must make the parent exit non-zero with a FAIL line that names the child. Before the fix the
parent accepted exit 1 and never checked that the ladder was complete, so it exited 0.
